# Principles of Psychological First Aid (PFA)

## Overview
Psychological First Aid (PFA) is an evidence-informed modular approach to help children, adolescents, adults, and families in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism. PFA is designed to reduce the initial distress caused by traumatic events and to foster short- and long-term adaptive functioning.

## Core Principles
1. **Safety**: Ensure immediate physical and emotional safety.
2. **Calm & Comfort**: Help survivors feel calm and comforted.
3. **Connectedness**: Facilitate connections with loved ones and social supports.
4. **Self-Efficacy**: Encourage a sense of self-efficacy and empowerment.
5. **Hope**: Foster realistic hope for the future.

## PFA Core Actions
- **Contact & Engagement**: Initiate contact in a non-intrusive, compassionate, and helpful manner.
- **Safety & Comfort**: Enhance immediate and ongoing safety, and provide physical and emotional comfort.
- **Stabilization**: Calm and orient emotionally overwhelmed or disoriented survivors.
- **Information Gathering**: Identify immediate needs and concerns, gather information about the nature and severity of experiences.
- **Practical Assistance**: Offer practical help to address immediate needs and concerns.
- **Connection with Social Supports**: Link survivors with primary support persons or other sources of support, including family, friends, and community helping resources.
- **Information on Coping**: Provide information about stress reactions and coping to reduce distress and promote adaptive functioning.
- **Linkage with Collaborative Services**: Link survivors with available services needed at the time or in the future.

## Application in Clinical Practice
PFA is not professional therapy; it is a supportive intervention that can be delivered by mental health professionals and other disaster responders. In clinical settings, PFA principles can guide initial assessment and stabilization before longer-term treatment planning.

## NCTSN PFA Model
The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) PFA model emphasizes:
- **Provider attitudes**: Being patient, responsive, and sensitive.
- **Cultural considerations**: Adapting approaches to cultural, religious, and ethnic backgrounds.
- **Developmental considerations**: Tailoring approaches to age and developmental stage.
- **Ethical considerations**: Maintaining confidentiality, obtaining consent, and ensuring do-no-harm.
